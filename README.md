# BayesianClustering
Repository for generic EM/hierarchical clustering algorithm (to be used for jet clustering at CMS).


To do:
- `Matrix.cc`
	- make sure all dims match for mult, add
	- if dims aren't set, set them; otherwise make sure they match
- `GaussianMixture.cc`
	- make sure there is data set before Initialize()
